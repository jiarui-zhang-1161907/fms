        <!-- Lead paragraph explaining the purpose of the FMS -->
        <p class="lead">Te Waihora FMS is a system designed to model stock management on a farm. The primary goal is to help farmers simulate the optimal number of livestock (such as cows) that their farm can sustain based on the available pasture (grass).</p>
        <!-- List of insights provided by the FMS -->
        <p class="lead">This tool provides valuable insights into:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>The current number of animals on the farm.</li>
            <li>The average weight of the livestock.</li>
            <li>How much pasture is available for consumption.</li>
            <li>Strategies for managing stock movements and feeding schedules.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Lead paragraph explaining how farmers can use the FMS -->
        <p class="lead">By using this simulator, farmers can make informed decisions regarding:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>Stock density and distribution across different paddocks.</li>
            <li>Optimal times for moving stock to new pastures.</li>
            <li>Supplemental feeding requirements during periods of low pasture growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Final lead paragraph summarizing the benefits of the FMS -->
        <p class="lead">Our system aims to balance the needs of the livestock with the sustainable use of pasture resources, ensuring both the health of the animals and the productivity of the farm.</p>
